    "The Wrapper method is computationally expensive as it involves training and evaluating a model for each subset of features, but it can capture the interactions between features and their relationship with the target variable, which is not possible with the Filter method.

    "1.Lack of consideration for interaction effects: The Filter method evaluates the relevance of each feature independently, without considering the interaction effects between them. However, interactions between features can be important for accurately predicting the target variable, and ignoring them can result in suboptimal feature selection.\n",
